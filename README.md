DESCRIPTION-
1. Introduction
The Task 2 project is a real-time chat application that allows multiple users to communicate instantly through a web interface. This project demonstrates how to use Node.js and Express.js for the backend, along with Socket.IO to enable two-way, real-time communication between the server and connected clients.

Real-time chat systems are essential in modern web applications, from social media to customer support tools. This project focuses on building the core functionality of such a system—instant messaging—by implementing socket-based connections without relying on constant page refreshes.

2. Objectives
The main objectives of the task are:

To design a simple, user-friendly chat interface.

To use WebSocket technology via Socket.IO for instant communication.

To manage multiple client connections simultaneously.

To broadcast messages sent by one user to all connected users in real time.

To handle user connections and disconnections dynamically.

3. Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structuring the chat interface.

CSS3 – For styling and layout.

JavaScript – For client-side interactivity.

Node.js – For creating the backend server.

Express.js – For handling HTTP requests and serving static files.

Socket.IO – For enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between server and clients.

4. Features
The chat application offers the following core features:

Real-Time Messaging – Messages are delivered instantly to all connected users.

Broadcast Communication – A message from any client is sent to every connected client, ensuring synchronous chat.

User Connection Notifications – When a user joins or leaves, other participants are notified.

Simple and Clean UI – A minimal layout with a message display area, input box, and send button.

Multi-User Support – Handles multiple users connected at the same time without performance loss.

5. Workflow
The process begins with the server setup:

The backend uses Express.js to serve static HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files.

Socket.IO is initialized to listen for client connections.

When a user opens the chat app in their browser:

The browser establishes a WebSocket connection to the server through Socket.IO.

When the user types and sends a message:

The message is sent to the server through a socket.emit() event.

The server then uses io.emit() to broadcast the message to all connected clients.

All connected clients instantly display the new message without reloading the page.

When a user disconnects (e.g., closes the tab), the server detects it and notifies other users.

6. Output
The chat application interface consists of:

A message display area that shows all messages in chronological order.

A text input box for typing new messages.

A send button to submit the message.
When a message is sent, it appears instantly on all clients’ screens. Similarly, joining or leaving users trigger notifications visible to all.

7. Error Handling
To ensure a smooth user experience, basic error handling is implemented:

If the server goes offline, the client detects the disconnection and can alert the user.

Empty messages are ignored to maintain chat quality.

Connection events are monitored to handle reconnections if needed.

8. Conclusion
This real-time chat application demonstrates how WebSocket-based communication works in a Node.js environment. It showcases the power of Socket.IO for building responsive, event-driven applications.

The application is scalable, meaning additional features like usernames, private messages, chat rooms, and message storage in databases can be added easily. The knowledge gained from this project is applicable to various real-time systems, including multiplayer games, live collaboration tools, and online customer support systems.
